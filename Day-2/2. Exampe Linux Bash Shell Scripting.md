1. Find your Shell
```
echo $0
cat /etc/shells
cat /etc/passwd | grep codespace
```

2. What is Shell Scripting
- All script be be executed should have proper exectureable file permission e.g. rwxr-rx-x

- To change permissions:
`chmod a+x script-name`
where
 a = all
 x = executeable

3. Example Basic Adminstrator Tasks
```
    top
    df -h
    free -m
    uptime
``` 
Create Basic Admin Script

`vim adminscript`

```
#!/bin/bash
# Author: Sup TTS
# Date: 20/09/23
# Description: This sript will run basic admin commands
# Date Modified: 20/09/23
echo 
echo This script will run basic administrative commands
echo 
top  | head -10
echo
df -h 
echo 
uptime
echo 
free -m
echo End of Script
```

`chmod a+x adminscript`

`./adminscript`

4. Exit Status
```
0 = OK or Successful
1 = Minor problem
2 = Serious trouble
3-55 = Everything else
```

5. Example of Scripting for Automation
```
cat <<EOF | tee myhosts2
192.168.64.3
192.168.64.4
192.168.64.5

EOF

```

```

cat <<EOF | tee ping-script-all
# !/bin/bash
# Description: This script to check connectivity and donâ€™t show the output on screen
# /dev/null is a file on linux that everything you put it hear it will disappear

hosts="myhosts"

for ip in $(cat $hosts)

do 
ping -c1 $ip &> /dev/null
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]
   then
   echo $ip is OK
   else
   echo $ip is NOT OK
   fi
done

EOF

```
