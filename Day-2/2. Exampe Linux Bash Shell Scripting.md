1. Find your Shell
```
echo $0
cat /etc/shells
cat /etc/passwd | grep codespace
```

2. What is Shell Scripting
- All script be be executed should have proper exectureable file permission e.g. rwxr-rx-x

- To change permissions:
`chmod a+x script-name`
where
 a = all
 x = executeable

3. Example Basic Adminstrator Tasks
```
    top
    df -h
    free -m
    uptime
``` 
Create Basic Admin Script

`vim adminscript`

```
#!/bin/bash
# Author: Sup TTS
# Date: 20/09/23
# Description: This sript will run basic admin commands
# Date Modified: 20/09/23
echo 
echo This script will run basic administrative commands
echo 
top  | head -10
echo
df -h 
echo 
uptime
echo 
free -m
echo End of Script
```

`chmod a+x adminscript`

`./adminscript`

4. Exit Status
```
0 = OK or Successful
1 = Minor problem
2 = Serious trouble
3-55 = Everything else
```

5. Example of Scripting for Automation
```
cat <<EOF | tee myhosts2
192.168.64.3
192.168.64.4
192.168.64.5

EOF

```

```

cat <<EOF | tee ping-script-all
# !/bin/bash
# Description: This script to check connectivity and don’t show the output on screen
# /dev/null is a file on linux that everything you put it hear it will disappear

hosts="myhosts"

for ip in $(cat $hosts)

do 
ping -c1 $ip &> /dev/null
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]
   then
   echo $ip is OK
   else
   echo $ip is NOT OK
   fi
done

EOF

```
## Script to Delete Old Files
```
-Find and delete files older than 90 days
-Find and rename old files to filename.old or filename.archive
-create very some testing file with very old date stamp

# touch -d "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 12:30:00" file1
# touch -d "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 12:30:00" file2
# touch -d "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 12:30:00" file3
# touch -d "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 12:30:00" file4

# find /home/suparuek -mtime +90 -exec ls -l {} \;
```
`vim delete-old-file-script`

```
#!/bin/bash
# Description: This script will delete files older than 90 days

find /home/suparuek -mtime +90 -exec ls -l {} \;
```
```
chmod a+x delete-old-file-script
./delete-old-file-script
```

11. Creating Scripts for backup

Plan

- Create a tar file of the /etc directory.

- Compress the tar file.

- Transfer the file to server archive1.

The contents of backup_server1.sh are as follows:
```
#!/bin/bash

# Create a tar file of /etc.
sudo tar cvf server1_etc.tar /etc

# Compress the tar file
gzip -9 server1_etc.tar

# Transfer the file to archive1 into the /server1/backups directory
scp server1_etc.tar.gz archive1:/server1/backups
```

Save the file, give it execute permission, and it’s ready to use. The /server1/backups directory on the archive1 system should be executable and writeable by the user placing the backups into it. For better security, you should designate a backup user and create backup directories with permissions restricted to that user.

Create a Backup and Restore (bur) user on all systems and set up passwordless SSH key files for the bur user. Set up cron jobs for backups as the bur user on all systems:

`drwx------    2 bur  bur         64 Oct  4 08:01 backups`

Here is the crontab for the bur user on server1:
`0 2 * * * /home/bur/backup_server1.sh`

The bur user’s crontab will back up server1’s /etc directory every day at 2 a.m. The backups will transfer to archive1 into the /server1/backup directory. You need to set up this scenario on every system. The backup for archive1 should be sent to a different system.

The /etc directory isn’t the only directory you need to back up. This is just an example. You might need to back up /home, /var/www/html, /opt, and others to restore a system to its previous state before a security incident or failure. The crontab (scheduled task) will be explained in detail in the next section.
