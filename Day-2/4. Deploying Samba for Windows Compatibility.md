# Deploying Samba for Windows Compatibility
Samba is a suite of utilities that enable Windows interoperability for Linux and Unix. Samba provides secure, stable, file and print services for non-Windows systems using the Server Message Block/Common Internet File System (SMB/CIFS) protocol. Samba has its own authentication structure consisting of permissions and passwords.

Using Samba, Linux systems may do the following:

- Share directories, filesystems, and printers with Windows computers

- Mount Windows shares

- Browse the network for shares provided by Windows and other Linux computers

- Participate in Windows domain authentication and authorization

- Use Windows name resolution services

- Use shared printers

With Samba installed on Linux servers, Windows computers may do the following:

- Browse Linux shares

- Use shared printers

- Map network drives to Linux shares
