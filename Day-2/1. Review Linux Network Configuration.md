### Denying SSH access for the root user
You’ll have to check your /etc/ssh/sshd_config for the following line:

`PermitRootLogin yes`

Change the yes to no and restart the SSH service:

`sudo systemctl restart sshd`


### Using keys rather than passwords for authentication
Password authentication is the least secure method for authenticating users. Using key files is much more secure and efficient. You must make the following changes to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and restart sshd for the new configuration to take effect:

`PasswordAuthentication yes`

Change the yes to no and then look for the following two entries to ensure they’re uncommented and set as shown:

```
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
```
Restart sshd to enable the new settings:

`sudo systemctl restart sshd`

On the client side (local system), users need to do the following to set up key pair authentication. Create the public/private key pair. This example is for the user `suptts`, and the remote target system is 192.168.1.99:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
ssh-copy-id suptts@192.168.1.99
ssh suptts@192.168.1.99
```
